title: Examples Are Working Once Again
tags: update
---

After a brief period of faultiness (which *of course* coincided with our announcement on Hacker News), all of our examples are working. We were linking to outdated version of intention.js, but using the latest version's syntax. As a result, the responsive grid demo only "shrunk" with a window resize... But now it's all operational! You should see a rearrangement of elements in addition to some shrinking.

For your convenience, here is a quick list of our current examples:
- [Responsive Grid Demo](/2013/03/10/grid-demo.html)
- [Scroll Depth Testing](/2013/03/11/scroll-depth-tracking.html) *(now with more implementations and documentation!)*
- [Weird Walking Man Animation](/2013/03/12/walking-man.html)
- [Super Simple Stylesheet Loader (with tips on initialization)](/2013/08/18/Stylesheet-Loader.html) *(initialization will be coming to the docs soon)*
- [Response Times and Performance Test](/2013/08/19/Response-and-Performance.html)

Enjoy!
